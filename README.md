# I, Monster

A small tabletop game I'm making to practice godot & unity later on.

## Narrative

Among the populace there live beings who do not align with what we might call “a normal human.” Cultists, lizard men, ethereal beings, and others. You are one such abnormality.
Within your vicinity, the locals have caught that something is wrong, but they can’t pinpoint what. They will find something soon, and if they don’t they’ll keep digging until they do.
You and another target have nothing personal against eachother, but it’s now whoever flees first, or is caught last.

## Summarized Rules

A 2-player deckbuilder where at the start of the game, each player picks a character that changes their starting deck and the main deck's contents. Both players seek to raise eachother's *Suspicion*, where if it reaches 20, the player in question loses. To do so they'll modify and improve their deck until only one abnormality remains standing.

## Characters

- **Fly**: A person with a fly for a head. No particular goal.
- **Cultist**: Incentivized goal is to gain an expensive card that wins the game.
- **Shapeshifter**: Incentivized goal is to play a lot of cards at once.
- **Ghost**: Incentivized goal is to remove cards from the deck.

## Setup & Gameplay

1. When the game begins, each player selects a different character. In case both players want the same character, both players select a "backup" character (may be the same) and toss a coin to decide who gets the original choice.
2. Once the choices are made, add each character's Influence Deck to the Main Deck, and create a personal deck for each player by combining their character's Baseline Deck with the Universal Baseline Deck: 5 Mild Curiosity, 2 Mob Justice. Each player starts with 0 Suspicion.
3. Shuffle the Main Deck and both players' personal decks, and place the top 5 cards from the Main Deck in some place that's accessible and visible to both players; these cards are now [the shop?]. Both players draw 5 cards from their decks to their hands.
4. Choose who goes first by tossing a coin or intense argument.
5. Each player, in turn, takes their turn:
    - During their turn they may play cards from their hand to their Play Area to act on whatever the card says in its card description, or purchase cards from [the shop?] if they have enough Intrigue, or end their turn.
    - To purchase a card, a player must first have enough Intrigue, which is gained through specific cards in your deck. If you have enough, you place the chosen card in your discard pile, replace the removed card with the top card of the Main Deck, and reduce your current Intrigue by the card's cost.
    - If a player chooses to end their turn, they must discard their hand and playing deck into the discard pile, which is face-up and can be browsed by all players. Their Intrigue is set to 0. Afterwards, they draw 5 cards from their deck, and the other player begins their turn.
    - If a player needs to draw a card from their deck, but their deck has no cards in it, shuffle the player's discard pile, place it face-down, and use it as their new deck.
6. If any player reaches 20+ suspicion at the end of either player's turn, they lose.

If there's conflict between the rules and the card effects, follow the card effects' description.

## Keywords

- **Erase:** Remove a card from the game. It does not matter where you place it, it will not return to this match.
- **Discard:** Place a card into your discard pile.
- **Inflict/Reduce Suspicion:** Inflict means to increase the opponent's suspicion by the relevant value. Reduce is to lower your own.
